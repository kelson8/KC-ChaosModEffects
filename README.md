# Effect List
So far there are these in here:

Break vehicle glass 
* This is incomplete, it will break the vehicle windshield and all windows if a player is in one.

Change license plates
* This will eventually change all vehicle license plate texts in the area to a random text.
For now, it just changes it to a set text

Chaos Test
* Original script from the example for testing, mostly disabled

Draw text to screen
* Draw random text from a list onto the top left of the screen under the Chaos Mod timer.

Enable military base alarms
* This enables the alarms without getting cops at the military base, although it doesn't seem to turn back off yet.

Ped test
* So far this just puts all peds in the sky, can be adapted to work for other things.

Stop all vehicles
* Stop all vehicles, make it to where the player and other peds cannot drive at all until the effect is over.
